# Imbalanced Data Handling
Ongoing project to implement different strategies to improve detection of positive classes in a severely unbalanced data set such as financial transactions.

In this project, I intend to implement different types of classifiers with the aim of enhancing the performance of basic but trusted classifiers such as logistics regression. So far three methods have been fully implemented and assessed under the following categories:

(a) Basic Classifiers: Logistic regression

(b) Cascaded Classifiers: Enhanced logistic regression (i.e logistic regression with gradient boosting)

(c) Ensemble Classifiers: Random Forest classifier


More methods would be added in later versions of the code as necessary.
